# SAST-and-DAST-DevSecOps

This README provides a summary of the key concepts from the article [SAST and DAST in DevOps: Everything You Should Know](https://k21academy.com/devops-job-bootcamp/sast-and-dast-in-devops/).

## Summary: SAST and DAST in DevOps

The article explores the significance of integrating Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) into the DevOps lifecycle to enhance software security.

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

- **Definition**: Analyzes source code, bytecode, or binary code without executing the program to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Benefits**:
  - Early detection of security flaws.
  - Improved code quality.
  - Cost reduction by addressing issues early.
  - Assists in compliance with regulatory standards.
  - Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Select appropriate SAST tools compatible with your tech stack.
  2. Configure tools for regular codebase scanning.
  3. Train developers on secure coding practices.
  4. Continuously update rulesets to adapt to emerging threats.

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

- **Definition**: Simulates attacks on running applications to identify vulnerabilities by analyzing responses.
- **Benefits**:
  - Realistic testing through simulation of real-world attack scenarios.
  - Identification of runtime vulnerabilities.
  - Continuous monitoring capabilities.
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Determine critical areas requiring DAST testing.
  2. Configure tools to simulate attack scenarios.
  3. Automate scanning within the CI/CD pipeline.
  4. Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and impact.

### SAST vs. DAST

- **SAST**: Conducted earlier in the development process, focusing on source code.
- **DAST**: Executed on running applications, focusing on runtime behavior.
- **Combined Approach**: Utilizing both provides a comprehensive security assessment, addressing vulnerabilities at both code and runtime levels.

### Best Practices

1. Integrate SAST and DAST tools into CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks.
2. Conduct regular code reviews and DAST scans.
3. Provide ongoing security training for developers.
4. Foster collaboration between development, operations, and security teams.

###  Challenges

- Potential for false positives/negatives requiring manual verification.
- Need for continuous maintenance and updates of tools.
- Complex configurations tailored to specific applications and environments.

### Future Trends

- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Combines SAST and DAST capabilities for real-time vulnerability detection.
- **Machine Learning and AI**: Enhances accuracy and reduces false positives in security tools.
- **Shift-Left Security**: Emphasizes incorporating security early in the development process.
